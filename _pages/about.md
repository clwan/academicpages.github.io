About me
--------
Hey, there. I am a Ph.D candidate on Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University, where I am fortunated to be advised by [Prof. Chi Zhang](https://zcslab.github.io/) from Indiana University School of Medicine. My research focus is to develop machine learning algorithms and statistical models in comprehension and representation of complex data ([NAR](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/18/e111/5542876)).

At IU, I also collobrated deeply with [Prof. Xiongbin Lu](https://xiongbinlulab.org) in deciperhering antigen presentation in the cancer microenvironment ([JCI cover letter](https://www.jci.org/articles/view/140837)). Industry-wise, I was an applied scienst intern at Amazon, working with [Dr. Tong Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=SSBJh9oAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) on substitable product recommendation and general machine learning questions ([NeurIPS](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/file/1def1713ebf17722cbe300cfc1c88558-Paper.pdf), [CIKM](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3340531.3412156), [AAAI](https://ojs.aaai.org//index.php/AAAI/article/view/6072)). 

Prior to Purdue, I received B.S in Biology and Minor in Business Administration from University of Science and Technology of China. At USTC, I have participanted in the mammalian near-infrared vision project under the supervision of [Prof. Xue Tian](https://www.xuelab.ustc.edu.cn/) ([Best of Cell 2019](https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(19)30101-1.pdf)). And worked with [Prof. Yuanwei Zhang](http://www.biostacs.com/index.html) on developing RNA sequencing analysis platforms ([Bioinformatics](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/20/3289/2976718)).


Recent News
