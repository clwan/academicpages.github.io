About me
--------
Hey, there. I joined Genentech Research and Early Development as AI Scientist. I recently obtained my Ph.D degree from Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University. I received B.S in Biology from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2016.

My research lies in the intersection of machine learning and Computational Biology, with specific focus on
- Knowledge generalization and representation ([NeurIPS](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/file/1def1713ebf17722cbe300cfc1c88558-Paper.pdf), [CIKM](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3340531.3412156), [AAAI](https://ojs.aaai.org//index.php/AAAI/article/view/6072)).
- Modeling and analysis of Biological data ([NAR](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/18/e111/5542876), [JCI](https://www.jci.org/articles/view/140837), [Bioinformatics](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/20/3289/2976718)).
