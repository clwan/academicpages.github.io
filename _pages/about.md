About me
--------
Hey, there. I am a Ph.D candidate on Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University, where I am fortunated to be advised by [Prof. Chi Zhang](https://zcslab.github.io/) from Indiana University School of Medicine. I received B.S in Biology from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2016.

My research lies in the intersection of machine learning and Computational Biology, with specific focus on
- Knowledge generalization and representation ([NeurIPS](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/file/1def1713ebf17722cbe300cfc1c88558-Paper.pdf), [CIKM](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3340531.3412156), [AAAI](https://ojs.aaai.org//index.php/AAAI/article/view/6072)).
- Modeling and analysis of Biological data ([NAR](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/18/e111/5542876), [JCI](https://www.jci.org/articles/view/140837), [Bioinformatics](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/20/3289/2976718)).

- Quite honored to got the invitation as a PC member for ICML, IJCAI, KDD and UAI. Would also honor all other reviewer opportunities, if any. Haha. 

- So excited to share that Changlin will join [Prof. Christina Leslie](https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski/labs/christina-leslie)'s lab @MSKCC as summer research intern in 2021. (Yeah, I will be there on-site. Hit me up and coffee is on me!)

- Our single cell denoising pipeline has been accepted by IEEE BIBM 2020, a joyful collaboration with [Dr. Dongya Jia](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lz2H6dsAAAAJ&hl=en).

- Our Boolean tensor factorization method has been accepted by NeurIPS 2020, this is first of its kind method to tackle tensor factorization problem under geometric consideration.
